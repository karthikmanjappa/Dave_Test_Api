In this assignment, I tested both an API and a website. For the API part, I used the public Reqres API to check if it returns the right responses, handles errors properly, and creates new users. I also set up a small load test to see how it works with multiple users.
For the website part, I used Selenium to test the DaveAI website. I checked if the site loads correctly, the logo and buttons are visible, and navigation works as expected. The tests include setup and cleanup steps so the browser opens and closes properly.
